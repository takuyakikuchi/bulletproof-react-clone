# Bulletproof React Clone

## About

A clone app of bulletproof-react to learn good design in React applications.
For study purposes, instead of cloning the original repository, a new application is created referencing the original repository.

The original repository: https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react

## Changes from the original repository

As for the project design, I referred to the original repository and kept it mostly to learn from it.
However, I picked different tools for what I think is better option at the time of implementation.(See the "Tech Selection" section below)
Also, I used the latest version of the tools, so there are some differences from the original repository for how to use the third party libraries.

- Instead of creating the app with "create react app", I used Vite.
- I added Chromatic to deploy Storybook.
- Mock related source code is moved from `src/test` to `src/mocks` following the MSW documentation.
- I use Vitest instead of Jest for testing.
