# Bulletproof React Clone

## About

A clone app of bulletproof-react to learn good design in React applications.
For study purposes, instead of cloning the original repository, a new application is created referencing the original repository.

The original repository: https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react

## Changes from the original repository

Basically, the original repository is used as it is, but any changes are noted here.

- Instead of creating the app with "create react app", I used Vite.
- The settings around routing are configured in the way recommended by the latest version at the time of implementation.
